## Binary Search Algorithm Demo
This Project is a demo of a Binary Search Algorithm that quickly locates a specific number in
a set of numbers. This is achieved by eliminating sections of the list that do not meet the requirements of
the target. Using a binary search algorithm is faster than using a linear sort as the data does not need to iterate through each item in the list. It simply checks for specific conditions and eliminates any value
that does not match.
